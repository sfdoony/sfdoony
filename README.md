- 👋 Hi, I’m Felix
- 👀 I’m interested in enabling companies to bring better technology and service to the world, and also enabling people to have better life
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming in Java (incl. Spring and front-end skills). Actually more than ten years ago, I had programming experience for some years. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (1) enterprise SCM solution - particularly planning and collaboration; and (2) social app differently from Facebook and WeChat. 
- 📫 I'm reachable by email: sfdoony@hotmail.com. Thanks.
